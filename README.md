## Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed on your system:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (LTS version recommended)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) or [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)
- [Vue CLI](https://cli.vuejs.org/) (if needed)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository.

2. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   npm install  # or yarn install
   ```

## Running the Project

### Development Mode

To start the development server, run:
```sh
npm run dev  # or yarn dev
```
This will launch the app on `http://localhost:5173/` (or another available port).

### Production Build

To create an optimized production build, use:
```sh
npm run build  # or yarn build
```
The built files will be placed in the `dist/` directory.

```sh
npm run preview  # or yarn preview
